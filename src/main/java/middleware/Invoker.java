 * Provide an INVOKER that accepts client invocations from REQUESTORS.

 * additional contextual information. The INVOKER reads the request
 * and demarshals it to obtain the OBJECT ID and the name of the operation.
 * It then dispatches the invocation with demarshaled invocation
 * parameters to the targeted remote object. That is, it looks up the
 * correct local object and its operation implementation, as described by
 * the remote invocation, and invokes it.
